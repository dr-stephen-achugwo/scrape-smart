### **Issue: Puppeteer Error - Browser Not Found at Configured Executable Path**

#### **Description**

When deploying the web scraper on **Render**, the service fails to launch due to Puppeteer not finding the browser at the specified executable path. The error log indicates:

```shell
Error: Browser was not found at the configured executablePath (/usr/bin/chromium-browser)
```

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Deploy the project on **Render**.
2. Start the Puppeteer-based scraping service.
3. Observe the deployment logs.

### Expected Behavior

- Puppeteer should be able to locate and launch Chromium successfully.

### Actual Behavior

- The service fails with an error stating that the **Chromium browser is not found** at the configured path.

### Environment Details

- **Hosting Service:** Render/vercel
- **Node.js Version:** (Specify your version)
- **Puppeteer Version:** (Specify your version)
- **OS:** Ubuntu (Render's default)

### Additional Context

- The scraper works **locally and inside a Docker container** but fails when deployed.
- The issue arises due to **custom Chromium paths and modified headers** used to prevent detection and bypass security restrictions.
