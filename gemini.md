# Gemini API for Text Summarization

The Gemini API, developed by Google DeepMind, offers advanced capabilities for text summarization, enabling developers to integrate powerful summarization features into their applications.

## Overview

Text summarization is the process of condensing a lengthy text into a shorter version that retains the most important information. The Gemini API facilitates both extractive and abstractive summarization, allowing for flexible integration based on specific use cases.

## Getting Started

To utilize the Gemini API for text summarization, follow these steps:

### 1. Obtain API Access
Acquire an API key from the [Google AI for Developers](https://ai.google.dev/) platform.

### 2. Set Up Development Environment
Install the necessary SDKs and libraries. For Python, this involves installing the `google-generative-ai` library.

```bash
pip install google-generative-ai
```

### 3. Initialize the Gemini API Client
Configure the client with your API key and specify the desired model.

```python
import google.generativeai as gemini

gemini.configure(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

model = gemini.get_model(name='models/gemini-1.5')
```

### 4. Perform Text Summarization
Use the `generate_text` method to summarize your input text.

```python
response = gemini.generate_text(
    model=model,
    prompt='Summarize the following text:\n\n' + long_text
)

summary = response.result
```

## Example: Summarizing a PDF Document

The Gemini API can process and summarize content from various formats, including PDFs. Here's how to summarize a PDF document:

```python
import google.generativeai as gemini

gemini.configure(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

model = gemini.get_model(name='models/gemini-1.5')

pdf_url = 'https://example.com/document.pdf'
response = gemini.generate_text(
    model=model,
    prompt='Summarize the content of this PDF:',
    input_data={'document': {'url': pdf_url}}
)

summary = response.result
```

This approach leverages the Gemini API's ability to handle various input formats, providing a concise summary of the document's content.
